/**
 * @brief Implements a range-only sensor model that generates constraints between a given robot
 * variable and any visible beacons (which have fixed, known positions).
 *
 * The main purpose for this sensor model is to demonstrate how to write your own sensor model
 * classes.
 *
 * For the purposes of this tutorial, let's imagine that you have developed a new robotic sensor
 * that receives messages from beacons that are placed around a warehouse at regular intervals.
 * The beacons are aware of their global positions in the map frame, and send their own global
 * position to the robot's sensor. The robot's sensor is sensitive to range, so readings that
 * come from farther away have noisier range readings. The sensor driver is aware of this and
 * publishes certainty (in the form of variance) in the message. The message is of type
 * workshop_msgs/msg/BeaconRangeArray. It contains a vector of workshop_msgs/msg/BeaconRange
 * messages. Each message has the following fields:
 *  - "position", geometry_msgs/Point - The beacon's fixed, known map-frame pose
 *  - "range", float64 - The sensor's noisy measured range to the beacon
 *  - "sigma", float64 - The standard deviation of the measurement, in metres
 *
 * The "sensor model" class provides an interface to ROS, allowing sensor messages to be received.
 * The sensor model class also acts as a "factory" (in a programming sense) that creates new sensor
 * constraints for each received sensor measurement, and forwards those constraints to the fuse
 * optimizer. The optimizer is where the constraints from all configured sensors are combined, and
 * the best possible value for each state variable is determined.
 *
 * Each fuse SensorModel is implemented as a plugin, which is loaded by the optimizer at runtime.
 * This allows new sensor models to be implemented outside of the main fuse package, such as in
 * this task8 package. The fuse SensorModel base class defines a few basic methods for
 * communicating between the derived SensorModel and the optimizer.
 *  - initialize()
 *    This is called by the optimizer after construction. This is a common pattern used by plugins.
 *    This is often when the Parameter Server is queried for configuration data.
 *  - start()
 *    Tells the sensor model to start producing constraints. This is commonly where fuse sensor
 *    models first subscribe to their sensor data topics.
 *  - stop()
 *    Tells the sensor model to stop producing constraints. fuse sensor models typically unsubscribe
 *    from topics here.
 *  - graphCallback()
 *    The optimizer provides the sensor model with the latest set of optimized states. For simple
 *    sensor models, this is likely not needed. But something maintaining a database of visual
 *    landmarks or similar may need access to the current set of landmarks.
 *  - TransactionCallback
 *    This is a little different than the other interfaces. This is a callback provided *to* the
 *    SensorModel plugin. That callback is executed by the plugin whenever new constraints are ready
 *    to be sent to the optimizer.
 *
 * An issue with the SensorModel base class is a rather complex threading model, where
 * TransactionCallbacks can be executed at any time by any of the sensor model plugins. To make
 * derived sensor models easier to implement, the AsyncSensorModel base class is provided, which
 * hides most of the thread synchronization details. The AsyncSensorModel class provides its own
 * callback queue and spinner, making it act much like a typical, single-threaded ROS node. All of
 * the original base SensorModel methods are wrapped. Instead, slightly modified versions are
 * provided, which are executed within the AsyncSensorModel's spinner thread.
 *  - onInit() can be overridden instead of initialize()
 *  - onStart() can be overridden instead of start()
 *  - onStop() can be overridden instead of stop()
 *  - onGraphUpdate() can be overridden instead of graphCallback()
 *  - sendTransaction() can be called instead of TransactionCallback()
 *
 * Additionally, the AsyncSensorModel base class provides a public and private node handle that are
 * pre-configured for use with the spinner's thread and callback queue. These should be used instead
 * of creating your own, in much the same way that nodelets provide methods for accessing properly
 * configured node handles.
 *
 * All of the sensor models provided by the fuse_models package use the AsyncSensorModel base class,
 * and it is the recommended way to start developing new sensor models.
